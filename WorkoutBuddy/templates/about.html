          <p>Despite the COVID-19 pandemic and virtual classes, Vinay Konuru ’24 and Ben Cai ’24 still wanted
            to work out
            with friends. Unfortunately, everyone had different schedules, goals, and exercise preferences,
            especially in quarantine. As a result, Vinay and Ben had to exercise on their own, and they
            struggled to
            motivate themselves. Fortunately, Vinay and Ben met each other and other workout-eager
            classmates in the
            Class of 2024 Princeton group chat. After much planning, they finally found suitable workout
            partners.

                    <p>All your TigerGainz responses/workout preferences are
                      securely
                      stored and solely used to create workout buddy matches and your TigerGainz
                      profile. Your
                      TigerGainz profile is only available to other TigerGainz users who have still
                      not chosen
                      a match.</p>

                      each
                      other. Can we request new Princeton workout buddies/groups? If so, how?</h3>
                    <hr class="my-4">
                    <p>Yes, you both can request new Princeton workout
                      buddies/groups. To
                      do this, please go to the Database section and click the “Take me off the
                      database
                      please” button. Then, click the sign up button to complete the form again (note:
                      this
                      will replace your old responses).</p>

                      Can I edit my
                      workout preferences? If so, how?</h3>
                    <hr class="my-4">
                    <p>Yes, you can edit your workout preferences. To do this,
                      please go to
                      the Database section and click the “Take me off the database please” button.
                      Then, click
                      the sign up button to complete the form again (note: this will replace your old
                      responses). However, this also means you may get different matches.</p>

                    <h3 class="links">4. Why am I getting no matches on my initial search? What
                      should I do? How long will I have to wait for a match?</h3>
                    <hr class="my-4">
                    <p>In the unlikely scenario that TigerGainz finds no suitable
                      matches upon form submission - most likely due to uncommon workout preferences -
                      you should click the “Take me off the database please” button in the Database
                      section and then complete form again with broader preferences. On the other
                      hand, if you have already submitted the form and are still not
                      getting matches, that means someone hasn’t chosen you to be their workout buddy
                      or group yet. You may have to wait a few days. If you don’t want to wait for
                      someone to choose you, please resubmit your form
                      (see above) or check out the TigerGainz directory.</p>
                    <hr class="my-4">
                    <h3 class="links">5. I haven’t heard back from TigerGainz in a while and I’m
                      still looking for a match. What should I do?</h3>
                    <hr class="my-4">
                    <p>Please go to the Database section and click the “Take me
                      off the database please” button. Then, click the sign up button to complete the
                      form again. Hopefully, if there are still Princetonians looking for a workout
                      buddy or
                      group, you should instantly get matches. Alternatively, you can check out the
                      TigerGainz directory.</p>

                    <h3 class="links">6. How can I maximize my chances of getting a match?</h3>
                    <hr class="my-4">
                    <p>To maximize your chances of getting a match, you should
                      select as many workout preferences you are comfortable with and choose the
                      “average” or “most common” response.</p>

                      haven’t matched with them?</h3>
                    <hr class="my-4">
                    <p>Yes, you can view other people’s profiles in the directory
                      even if they aren’t a match but only if you signed up for TigerGainz and you
                      have not already found a match.</p>
